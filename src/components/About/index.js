            Graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor's degree in
            biotechnology, but quickly realized a life surrounded by beakers,
            petri dishes and fruit flies was not for me. So I decided to take
            those analytical problem-solving skills and apply them to coding,
            and so far I could not be happier with my decision! My goals are to
            learn the ins and outs of web development, become a full-stack
            developer, and further expand my knowledge of coding and the
            possibilities it can bring.
