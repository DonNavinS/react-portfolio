      <p>
        Graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor's degree in
        biotechnology, but quickly realized a life surrounded by beakers, petri
        dishes and fruit flies was not for me. So I decided to take those
        analytical problem-solving skills and apply them to coding, and so far I
        could not be happier with my decision! My goals are to learn the ins and
        outs of web development, become a full-stack developer, and further
        expand my knowledge of coding and the possibilities it can bring.
